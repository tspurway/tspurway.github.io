</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Hustle is a distributed <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS">column oriented</a> style database built on
the <a class="reference external" href="http://discoproject.org">Disco Pipelined MapReduce</a> platform.  It is a traditional database in the sense
that it has a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model">relational model</a> of data organized into
<em>tables</em> and <em>columns</em> complying with a strict <em>schema</em>.  Unlike a traditional relational database, we chose to
eschew the SQL language, preferring instead to use a Python based
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain Specific Language (DSL)</a>.</p>
<p>When designing a relational database, you have to consider the query interface, and you have to look at SQL.  SQL is
probably one of the most successful computer languages in history.  Why <em>wouldn't</em> you use it?</p>
<div class="section" id="hustle-is-a-mapreduce-framework">
<h2>Hustle is a MapReduce Framework</h2>
<p>Although Hustle is a database, it grew out of a set of tools we built for the Disco MapReduce platform.  One of the
compelling features of Disco is that Python MapReduce jobs and their dependencies are seamlessly sent to the
worker nodes as <em>data</em> when the job is executed.  This means you simply write code, and <em>submit</em> that code to run.
You don't have to worry about <em>loading</em> the scripts on the cluster before you run the job, unlike
<a class="reference external" href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/api/org/apache/hadoop/filecache/DistributedCache.html">other MapReduce systems</a>.
This <em>low latency</em> and <em>low cost</em> Python execution in Disco made it very attractive to build the query facility
directly in Python.</p>
<p>Efficiency is another reason for building the query language in Python.  The Disco worker protocol already <em>speaks</em>
Python, and so executing Python during the query is essentially 'free'.  In order to accommodate a SQL interpreter in
the Disco tool-chain, we would probably implement it in Python anyway, as the end result would need to be executed
by the Disco worker.  It doesn't take very long to see that there would be significant development resources to
create a solution in SQL that doesn't appear as though it would be as performant at the 'free' Python solution.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at a Hustle query in Python:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
select(impressions.ad_id, h_sum(impressions.cpm_millis).named('total'), h_count(),
       where=(impressions.date &gt; '2014-01-13') &amp; (impressions.date &lt;= '2014-01-20'),
       order_by='total',
       desc=True,
       limit=5)
</pre>
<p>The <code>impression</code> object is Hustle <em>Table</em>.  Note that in Hustle, columns (like <em>ad_id</em> above) are referenced
using Python's <em>dot</em> notation, as though they were members of the <em>Table</em> class.  Also note how the <em>where</em> 'clause'
uses a overloaded functions both for the <em>comparison</em> operators (&lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, etc.) as well as for <em>logical</em>
operations (&amp;, | and ~).  For detailed documentation refer to the <a class="reference external" href="http://chango.github.io/hustle/howto/query.html">Hustle Query Guide</a>.</p>
<p>So far, this looks an awful lot <em>like</em> SQL, and it performs extremely well.  It is also extensible at a number of
levels.  This feature of Hustle is extremely important for using Hustle for diverse fields such as machine learning
or <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.notdot.net/2012/09/Dam-Cool-Algorithms-Cardinality-Estimation">Cardinality Estimation</a>.  Because
the operators and functions used in the <em>select()</em> function are simply written in Python, it is fairly easy to
extend the framework to accommodate new data types or functions to perform on that data.</p>
<p>Note that when you extend the Hustle framework, the extension will run across the Disco cluster in a fully
distributed fashion because the <em>select()</em> is implemented as a MapReduce pipeline (look at the <a class="reference external" href="http://chango.github.io/hustle/api/core.html#hustle.core.marble.Aggregation">Aggregation class</a> for a detailed discussion of
extending Hustle's aggregate functions).  Compare this to <em>stored procedures</em> in SQL.  Unlike Python under the Disco
platform, Standard SQL doesn't give you the tools to express distributed algorithms.  This is highlighted by the fact
that <a class="reference external" href="https://community.vertica.com/vertica/topics/since_stored_procedure_is_not_supported_by_vertica_so_whats_the_alternative_to_handle_it">major BigDB vendors don't even bother supporting stored procedures</a>.</p>
